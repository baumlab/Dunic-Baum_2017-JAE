Highlighted rows from <All specimens with gp and SL for exploration_cleaned.xlsx> were removed, except the VA.LOUT where I changed the gp width to 128.3 from 1283 
1)	Specimens with missing gh, gw, SL, and wt were removed
2)	Specimens with notes describing errors, or inconsistencies (e.g., dried fish, missing head, etc.) were removed
3)	See <All specimens with gp and SL for exploration.xlsx> for specimens that need things double checked â€“ e.g., species, measurement calculations (AP.VIRE where scale reading should be confirmed by length-weight relationship)

Changed VA.LOUT gape width to 128.3 in Dec 13 2012 analysis

*** Have not removed specimens that are missing SiteIDs or have "Site Not Certain"
